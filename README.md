# Revix
Revix is a lightweight JavaScript library that visualizes native Android/iOS view trees directly in the browser. Just provide a JSON dump of the view hierarchy, and Revix will reconstruct the UI layout with interactive layers, making it ideal for debugging, UI inspection, and visual regression workflows.
